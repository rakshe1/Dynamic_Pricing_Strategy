# Dynamic_Pricing_Strategy

By leveraging real-time data on demand, time of day, and location, this strategy tailors pricing to match customer willingness to pay and class availability, leading to a more efficient allocation of resources.

Key Business Goals:

Maximize Revenue: 
1) Capturing high-value customers during peak demand periods and offering attractive pricing during off-peak hours.

2)  Optimize Class Attendance: Improve class utilization by offering discounts or promotions during under-booked times and charging premium prices during high-demand periods

3)  Enhance Customer Experience: Provide more flexible pricing options that align with customer preferences, increasing retention and satisfaction.
